# ChatBot
Current version uses simple google gemini api to get response and feed that response again to api. 
Streamlit is used as frontend for this project.

### Note:
This is currently under development. 
##### Plans for future: 
Step 1: proper one on one chatbot. 
Step 2: get this llm, vector or rag trained with some niche to be a proper assitant in that niche. Like a chat assistant for customer support or an assistant professor in quantum physics.
